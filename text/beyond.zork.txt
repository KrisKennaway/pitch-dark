[description]
 
 Dread times have befallen the Kingdom of Quendor. The wizards have
 mysteriously disappeared. The Enchanter's Guild Hall lies in ruins.
 Villages are abandoned, drunken men mutter strange tales, and vicious
 monsters haunt the streets and wastelands. Now it falls to you, a lowly
 peasant, to unravel the meaning behind these ominous events. Will you
 accept the challenge?
 
 Of course you will. For you're a hardy adventurer, ready to confront the
 most fearsome foe. And in Beyond Zork, you have an arsenal of new weapons
 and abilities at your disposal.
 
 You start by designing your own character. Choose from such diverse
 attributes as strength, endurance, compassion, and luck, or let the
 computer select for you. As you venture onward, your character will evolve,
 reflecting your success in your quest.
 
 Beyond Zork's sophisticated new interface makes interaction more natural
 than ever. In the heat of battle, the special function keys let you strike
 the decisive blow with a single keystroke. There's even an on-screen map to
 chart your progress!
 
 As you grow in experience and abilities, you realize that you're being
 prepared for a great task, a task of which you know nothing... as yet. Your
 search for the answer will lead you deep underground, where unspeakable
 monsters guard the world's most fabulous treasure - the fabled Coconut of
 Quendor.
 
 Beyond Zork was written by Brian Moriarty, award-winning author of
 Wishbringer and Trinity. Fans of Infocom's fantasy series will recognise
 characters and locations from previous stories, while old and new players
 alike will enjoy exploring the Zorkian landscape as their challenge
 increases and their character grows in strength and power.
