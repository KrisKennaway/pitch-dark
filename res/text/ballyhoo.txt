[description]
 
 Spangleland! Sawdust and glitter, buffoons and cotton candy! It's a place
 where your wildest dreams come true! At least, that's what you think...
 until you get behind the scenes at the big top. Then you learn how easily
 sweet dreams can turn into nightmares.
 
 Beyond the spangles lies a seedy world of deception and crime. Exploring
 the tattered corners of the circus lot, you overhear a conversation about
 the owner's daughter. It seems she's been kidnapped, and the hired gumshoe
 couldn't find the nose on his face. Good samaritan that you are, you start
 poking around on your own.
 
 But watch your step. As the night progresses, you realize you're in as much
 danger as the little girl. For the kidnapper is lurking right there on the
 lot, trying to set you up for a permanent slot in the freak show.
