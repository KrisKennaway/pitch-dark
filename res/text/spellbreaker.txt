[description]
 
 Spellbreaker, the riveting conclusion to the Enchanter trilogy, explores
 the mysterious underpinnings of the Zorkian universe. A world founded on
 sorcery suddenly finds its magic failing, and only you, leader of the
 Circle of Enchanters, can uncover and destroy the cause of this paralyzing
 chaos.
 
 The very core of your civilization is under siege, and only a perilous
 journey through the black foundation of magic itself will yield a chance
 for survival.
 
 And although your triumph over this unknown Evil is uncertain, you must
 embark without hesitation and prove yourself the worthiest mage in the
 land.
 
 NOTE: this game is patched to remove the in-game copy protection. Belboz
 will always ask you which mage had the motto, "the hardest trick is making
 it look easy." The answer is Barsap.
