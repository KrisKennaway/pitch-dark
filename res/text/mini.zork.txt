[description]
 
 This is a condensed version of Zork I, reduced to make it viable for the
 cassette-based Commodore 64. The only Infocom story file ever intended to
 be run from cassette rather than disk, Mini-Zork has been compared to a
 Reader's Digest edition of a classic. It is one of several remakings of
 Zork from the final years of Infocom.
 
 In November 1990, a year after Infocom had effectively become defunct,
 Mini-Zork was given away with the British Commodore magazine "Zzap! 64"
 no. 67, which is now a collector's item.
