[description]
 
 And now... the next exciting episode of humanoids in space!
 
 How did you, a regular at Joe's Bar in Upper Sandusky, Ohio, end up on a
 Martian moon? Can you prevent the hideous space creature from abducting the
 naked heiress? Why does scratch 'n' sniff no. 2 smell so familiar? How many
 uses can you find for a rubber hose? Is it easy to remove a brass bikini?
 Is it hard to outsmart a robotoid sumo wrestler? Can you stop the Leather
 Goddesses' fiendish plan to turn all Earthlings into sex slaves?
 
 Learn the answers to these burning questions in Leather Goddesses of
 Phobos, Infocom's racy spoof of 1930s pulp fiction. But first, a word from
 our sponsor: Why put up with only one playing mode, when you can have
 three? That's right, three! So whether your tastes run to Tame, Suggestive,
 or Lewd, Leather Goddesses of Phobos can satisfy you!
