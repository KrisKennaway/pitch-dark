[description]
 
 "Join the Patrol, and see the Galaxy!" You took the poster's advice, bait
 and all, and marched right over to the recruitment station near your home
 on the backwater planet of Gallium. Images of exotic worlds, strange and
 colorful aliens, and Deep Space heroism had danced in your head as you
 signed the dotted line. And since that day the closest you've come to Deep
 Space heroism was scrubbing down the radioactive leper colony on Ishmael-3.
 
 But suppose that jumbo fortune cookie you got at Qwang's Take-Out Asteroid
 last shore leave was right. Maybe you will indeed narrowly escape disaster.
 It's even possible that you'll actually travel to an unknown corner of the
 Universe, where you'll save a doomed planet - or die in the attempt. In
 fact, we'll guarantee it - every crumb of it - because that's just the way
 the cosmic cookie crumbles.
