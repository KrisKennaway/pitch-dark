[description]
 
 It's an ordinary day in your ordinary little town, and you've been
 performing your ordinary mail clerk's duties in an altogether ordinary
 way. But there's something quite extraordinary in today's mail. It's a
 ransom note for a kidnapped cat, and it will lead you through unbelievably
 harrowing adventures to Wishbringer, a stone possessing undreamt-of powers.
 For though the note in question is addressed to someone in your ordinary
 little town, it's postmarked for Special Delivery to Parts Unknown. And its
 true destination is somewhere beyond your wildest dreams, c/o the magic of
 Infocom's interactive fiction.
