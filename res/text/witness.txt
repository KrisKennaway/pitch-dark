[description]
 
 February 1938, Los Angeles. FDR's New Deal is finally rolling. Hitler's
 rolling, too; this time through Austria. But as Chief Detective for a quiet
 burgh on the outskirts of L.A., you've got other fish to fry.
 
 One gilt-edged society dame is dead. And now it looks like some two-bit
 grifter is putting the screws to her multi-millionaire old man. Then you
 step in, and the shakedown turns ugly. You're left with a stiff and race
 against the clock to nail your suspect... unless you get nailed first!
 
 Nobody said a sordid family affair like this was going to be a cinch.
 Everyone from the knock-out heiress to the poker-faced butler may end up in
 the slammer before it's over. Ahead of you is a Gordian knot of motives and
 alibis. And the only testimony you can trust is that of your own eyes -
 because you are The Witness.
