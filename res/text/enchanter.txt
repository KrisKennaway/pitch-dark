[description]
 
 In Enchanter, the first of a spellbinding series in the tradition of Zork,
 you are a novice magician whom Fate has chosen to do singlehanded combat
 with a dark and fierce power. But worldly weapons will avail you naught,
 for your foe is the Evil Warlock who holds sway over the land.
 
 To defeat him, you will have to match your skills as a necromancer against
 his, casting spells you have learned from your masters in the Circle of
 Enchanters and other incantations you will acquire as you proceed on your
 quest.
 
 If you succeed, you will be elevated to a seat in the illustrious Circle;
 if you fail, your land will be doomed to an eternity of darkness.
