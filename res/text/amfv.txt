[description]
 
 It's 2031. The world is on the brink of chaos. In the United States of
 North America, spiraling crime and unemployment rates, decayed school
 systems and massive government regulations have led to a lazy, contentious
 society.
 
 To reverse this critical situation, government and industry leaders have
 developed a Plan combining the economic freedom and strong moral values of
 the 1950's with the technological advancements of the 21st century. Will
 the Plan ensure peace and prosperity? Or will it set the earth on a suicide
 course to destruction?
 
 As the world's first conscious, intelligent computer, only you can visit
 places that have never been seen before. Only you can view the future. And
 only you know what must be done to save humanity.
 
 A major departure for Infocom, A Mind Forever Voyaging is reminiscent of
 such classic works of science fiction as Brave New World and 1984. You'll
 spend less time solving puzzles, as you explore realistic worlds of the
 future.
 
 NOTE: This game is patched to remove the in-game copy protection. The code
 for the "Class One Security Mode Access Decoder" is always 12.
