[description]
 
 You're about to get yourself into very deep trouble.
 
 You're a backwater island's top diver and foremost expert on local
 shipwrecks. Which makes you perfect for the job a band of the island's
 shadiest characters has in mind for you. It's a simple business
 proposition: all you have to do is locate and salvage a fortune in sunken
 treasure. You stand to gain millions. The only drawback is, it could cost
 you your neck. Because to successfully recover the treasure, you'll have to
 survive the perils of diving in unknown waters - and the even greater
 danger of an untrustworthy crew. But none of that will stop you from taking
 the plunge. You're the type who believes that when stakes are this high,
 even when your odds are this low, it's worth running the risks of dealing
 with Cutthroats.
