[description]
 
 > Throw the sack at the troll.
 
 The troll, who is remarkably coordinated, catches the brown sack and, not
 having the most discriminating taste, gleefully eats it. The flat of the
 troll's axe hits you on the head...
 
 Welcome to Zork I: The Great Underground Empire.
 
 It beckons you into a world fraught with danger and discovery. Using all
 the cunning you can muster, you'll plunge far below the surface of the
 earth in search of the incomparable treasures of Zork. But this is no mere
 treasure hunt. During your amazing journey, you'll come face to face with
 creatures so outlandish, they defy description. And you'll wander through
 an underground domain so vast, with so many twists and turns, it can offer
 you new surprises no matter how many times you explore it.
