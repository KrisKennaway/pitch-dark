[description]
 
 More ghosts haunt the misty sea-coast and stone ramparts of Cornwall than
 anyplace else on earth. One such soul roams Tresyllian Castle: a pale
 phantom with flaxen hair and a luminous, flowing gown. It seems like a
 fanciful legend... until the spectral "White Lady" threatens the life of
 your friend Tamara!
 
 Arriving at the fog-shrouded castle, you meet a cast of eccentric
 characters ranging from a blue-blood debutante to an overly helpful butler.
 Has one of them donned the ghostly guise of the White Lady? Or has the
 drowned lover of Lord Jack, Tamara's fiance, returned to haunt her
 successor? Perhaps the spectre is seeking the valuable treasure hidden
 somewhere in the lavish rooms and secret passageways of the castle. The
 solution to the mystery, as well as the location of the treasure, changes
 in each of the four variations of Moonmist.
 
 Get ready to spend the night in a haunted castle. But don't sleep too
 soundly. The next victim might be you.
