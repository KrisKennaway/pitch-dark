[description]
 
 Ever since you arrived at G.U.E. Tech, you've heard stories about the
 creepy old campus basements and storage rooms, some so ancient that they
 contain only rotting piles of unidentifiable junk. Until now, you have
 never ventured lower than the ground floors of the monolithic classroom and
 dorm buildings, avoiding the warren of tunnels that connect them.
 
 But tonight, something draws you down into the mysterious depths of the
 institute. Perhaps it's the blizzard raging outside, making the outdoors as
 threatening as anything you could imagine within. Perhaps it's the
 nightmare you had, hinting at horrific mysteries below and leaving you with
 a strange object that seems to lead you inexorably downward. Or perhaps
 it's just another way for you to avoid writing that twenty page term paper
 you have due tomorrow.
 
 In any event, you soon find yourself wandering away from your computer and
 into the dark nether regions of G.U.E. Tech. Suddenly, you're in a world
 that rivals your most hideous visions, a realm of horror lurking beneath
 the calm corridors and study halls.
 
 Shapes emerge from dark corners. Eerie sounds draw closer. Slimy
 passageways lead to sights so horrifying that they will feed you nightmares
 for weeks.
 
 THE LURKING HORROR recalls the ghastly visions of H.P. Lovecraft and
 Stephen King, as author Dave Lebling turns an everyday world into a
 frightening web of uncertainty. The numerous puzzles will challenge both
 first-time and experienced players, and Lebling's chilling descriptions
 will leave you with images you'll never forget.
