[description]
 
 Don't Panic! Relax, because everything you need to know about playing The
 Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is contained in the pages of this manual.
 In this story, you will be Arthur Dent, a rather ordinary earth creature
 who gets swept up in a whirlwind of interstellar adventures almost beyond
 comprehension.
 
 As the story begins, bulldozers are waiting to reduce your house to rubble
 to make way for a motorway bypass. While you attempt to deal with this
 problem, your rather strange friend Ford Prefect drops by to tell you that
 the Earth is about to be demolished to make way for an interstellar bypass!
 If you survive this double threat, you'll embark on a series of inter-
 galactic misadventures even funnier than your worst nightmares!
 
 A special note for people who have read the book "The Hitchhiker's Guide to
 the Galaxy". Although the opening of the game is fairly similar to the
 book, the story quickly diverges, with lots of new material and different
 twists. Although familiarity with the story may make a few of the early
 puzzles easier, if you rely too heavily on this previous knowledge you will
 certainly end up getting misled.
