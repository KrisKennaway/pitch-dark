 Genre: fantasy
 Difficulty: ^^^^&

[description]
 
 The Wizard appears, floating nonchalantly in the air beside you. He grins
 sideways at you.
 
 The Wizard incants "Fantasize," but nothing happens. He shakes his wand.
 Nothing happens. With a slightly embarrassed glance in your direction, he
 vanishes.
 
 Expect the unexpected when you take on Zork II: The Wizard of Frobozz.
 
 As you explore the subterranean realm of Zork, you'll continually be
 confronted with new surprises. Chief among these is the Wizard himself,
 who'll constantly endeavor to confound you with his capricious powers. But
 more than that, you'll face a challenge the likes of which you've never
 experienced before.
