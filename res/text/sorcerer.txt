[description]
 
 Sorcerer, the second of a spellbinding fantasy series in the tradition of
 Zork, takes you on a magical tour through the darker side of Zorkian
 enchantment. Your journey begins with a cryptic diary - the last trace of
 the now-vanished Belboz the Necromancer, grand and powerful leader of the
 Guild of Enchanters. It is feared that Belboz is in thrall to evil sorcery.
 If so, the very existence of the Circle of Enchanters could be forfeit.
 
 To rescue the kingdom and locate your mentor in the treacherous mists of
 time, you must gain the power and cunning of a true Sorcerer.
