 Infidel finds you marooned by your followers in the heart of the deadly
 Egyptian Desert. A soldier of fortune by trade, you've come hither in

 its mysteries one by one.
 
 Through the Antechamber, the Barge Room, the Chamber of Ra, death will lick
 at your heels as you race to the shattering climax of this match of wits
 between you and the most ingenious architects, builders and murderers of
 all time - the ancient Egyptians.
