[description]
 
 In the 17th century, the seas are as wild as the untamed heart of a young
 woman. But when you set out on the schooner Lafond Deux, bound for the West
 Indies, your thoughts are only of your ailing father who awaits your care.
 Little do you know that your innocent journey will soon turn to dangerous
 adventure.  You barely survive an encounter with pirates, whose plans for
 you include a fate worse than death. The explosives, the rocky reefs, the
 vicious crocodile - all these are obstacles which you must overcome with
 cunning and agility. True, it's not easy; but at least you can control your
 fate. What you cannot control is much more dangerous: your passion for
 Nicholas Jamison, the handsome pirate captain.
 
 Tall and lean, with azure eyes that penetrate deep into your soul, he makes
 your blood quicken despite his unsavory past. When you're in his arms,
 swirling around the dance floor or secluded in the flowered depths of the
 gazebo, you are apt to forget your mission.
 
 But don't dally too long with Nick. For your father is waiting, and on his
 rescue lies the fate of more than one man. Prepare for adventure on the
 high seas, lass. You'll need every bit of pluck you can muster.
 
 In Plundered Hearts, Infocom brings your wildest fantasies to life. You'll
 throll to spine-tingling peril, heart-pounding romance, and challenging
 predicaments. To create this exotic adventure, author Amy Briggs read
 hundreds of romance novels, researched 17th century costumes and ships, and
 was wooed by a dashing pirate.
