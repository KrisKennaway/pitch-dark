[description]
 
 TWELVE HOURS TO SOLVE THE MYSTERY. ONE FALSE MOVE, AND THE KILLER STRIKES
 AGAIN.
 
 It's Deadline, and it puts you, the keen-eyed sleuth, against a 12-hour
 time limit to solve a classic locked-door mystery. Armed only with the
 clues inside this package and your own wits, you must sift through myriads
 of evidence and motives to track down the killer. No easy feat, for all six
 of your suspects exercise free will - coming and going, scheming and
 maneuvering independently of your actions. And some of these personalities
 are so treacherous that, should you make the wrong move, one of them may do
 you in.
