[description]
 
 The year is 1066. You are a Private, Seventh Class, in the Inquisition
 Guard. After being relieved by Earl at the Port Foozle Inquisition Gift
 Kiosk, you find yourself standing in the Headquarters of Frobozz
 Electric. Gesticulating in front of you is the Pastor of Disaster, the
 Minister of Sinister, the Grand Inquisitor. It appears he has a very
 special mission for you.
 
 "It is with great hope and expectation I send you on this mission," the
 Grand Inquisitor intones, his voice booming like distant, rumbling
 thunderheads. "We have discovered what appears to be a piece of the Great
 Underground Empire, never before explored. I would have sent Grubald the
 Bold, but he's busy. As is Matchlick the Mighty. So, 'tis you."
 
 "What of Linklaw the Lucky?" you ask shyly.
 
 "Laid up. I'm afraid 'tis you and none other. A simple, solo quest, one of
 fun and mirth, mischief and merriment, a jaunt, an excursion, a simple
 outing. Merely explore, enjoy yourself, and bring back news of what lies
 there, long-ago buried for countless ages."
 
 "And Fretsham the Fortunate?" you ask hopefully.
 
 "A fatality!" the Inquisitor booms. "Here," he says with evaporating
 patience, "take these and be of good cheer." He thrusts into your hands two
 things: a brass lantern of dubious quality, and a plastic sword of no
 antiquity or use whatsoever.
 
 "But what of Kolchack the --"
 
 "Enough! Kolchack is contracted. Remember, who is the boss of you!" He
 pauses briefly as if awaiting a reply. Then without warning, he answers his
 own question. "Me! I am the boss of you! Now begone!"
