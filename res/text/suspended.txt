[description]
 
 They said you would sleep for half a millennium - not an unreasonable
 length of time, considering you'd be in limited cryogenic suspension. Your
 body would rest at the planet's nerve center, an underground complex 20
 miles beneath the surface. Your brain, they told you, would be wired to a
 network of computers; your mind would continue to operate at a minimal
 level, overseeing maintenance of surface-side equilibrium. And you would
 not awake, so they promised, until your 500 years had elapsed - barring, of
 course, the most dire emergency.
 
 Then, and only then, you would be awakened to save your planet by
 strategically manipulating six robots, each of whom perceives the world
 differently. But such a catastrophe, you have been assured, could not
 possibly occur.
 
 Good morning.
