[description]
 
 There's something down there in the ocean, something terrifying. And you
 have to face it - because only you can save the Aquadome, the world's first
 undersea research station.
 
 The alarm sounds and your submarine, the Scimitar, is docked nearby. But
 not so fast - you haven't even tested the Scimitar in deep water, and the
 crew at the Aquadome may have a traitor in its ranks. So be careful! You
 have many possibilities to consider, mysteries to unravel, and life-and-
 death decisions to make!
 
 Success won't come easily. It may not come at all - because, if you
 challenge the deep without using all your wits, you just might wind up as
 shark bait!
