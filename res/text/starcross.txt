[description]
 
 Starcross, Infocom's science fiction mind-bender, launches you headlong
 into the year 2186 and the depths of space. And not without good reason,
 for you are destined to rendezvous with a gargantuan starship from the
 outer fringes of the galaxy, peopled with both harmful and helpful
 beings. But the great starship serves a far larger purpose than mere
 cultural exchange. It bears a challenge that was issued eons ago, from
 light years away - and only you can meet it.
