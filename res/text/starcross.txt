[description]
 
 Starcross, Infocom's science fiction mind-bender, launches you headlong
 into the year 2186 and the depths of space. And not without good reason,
 for you are destined to rendezvous with a gargantuan starship from the
 outer fringes of the galaxy, peopled with both harmful and helpful
 beings.
 
 But the great starship serves a far larger purpose than mere cultural
 exchange. It bears a challenge that was issued eons ago, from light
 years away - and only you can meet it.
 
 NOTE: this game is patched to remove the in-game copy protection. To set
 course for a UM, you may enter any coordinates for R, THETA, and PHI.
