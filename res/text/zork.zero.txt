[description]
 
 The Great Underground Empire is in its heyday. Upscale condos crowd the
 massive caverns. Subterranean highways stretch from Aragain to the Fublio
 Valley. And no adventurer has yet set foot in the open field west of the
 white house.
 
 But now both town and countryside are being abandoned, their inhabitants
 fleeing in the wake of a dread wizard's curse. The curse has already
 disposed of the royal Flathead family. It threatens to destroy the entire
 kingdom -- unless you can stop it.
 
 Your quest will take you to every corner of the empire, as you seek out
 objects ranging from the absurd to the sublime. The quixotic jester will
 test you with games, riddles, and tricks. The immense Flathead palace and
 its environs offer a multitude of surprises.
