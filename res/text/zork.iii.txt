[description]
 
 An old, oddly youthful man turns toward you slowly. His long, silver hair
 dances about him as a fresh breeze blows. "You have reached the final test,
 my friend! You are proved clever and powerful, but this is not yet enough!
 Seek me when you feel yourself worthy!"
 
 Zork III: The Dungeon Master draws you into the deepest and most mysterious
 reaches of the Great Underground Empire. Nothing is as it seems. And the
 one responsible for the shadow and darkness - the Dungeon Master - embodies
 the greatest mystery of all.
 
 In this test of wisdom and courage, you will face countless dangers. But
 what awaits you at the culmination of your odyssey is well worth risking
 all.
