 YOU'RE GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT
 
 You have walked into a hotbed of deceit and trickery. And now they're
 accusing you of something you couldn't have done. But they have proof that
 you did it. "You're a killer," they say. And until you can prove them
 wrong, you're guilty as charged - murder.
 
 Among society's upper crust, murder is the kind of nastiness that must be
 cleaned up quickly. So isn't it convenient that you, a struggling
 journalist looking for a good time and a good story, end up the scapegoat?
 The evidence is stacked against you, and you're being forced to prove your
 own innocence. And someone else's guilt. But, no one wants to help you.
 You're an outsider. And only an outsider could be so rude as to accept an
 invitation to the social event of the season. Then spoil it all.
