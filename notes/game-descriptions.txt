      BALLYHOO


1986         Mystery

Difficulty:    ^^^&&

[description]
Spurred by your natural curiosity, you stick around after the show in the
big top, hoping to catch an after-hours performance. Perhaps you'll get a
peek at an impromptu clown act, or watch the late-night feedings of the
exotic animals you goggled at earlier. But life at the circus isn't
glamorous after the audience has gone home: instead of flashy feats, you
overhear a mysterious conversation: a little girl - the circus owner's
daughter - has been kidnapped! Her father is too naive (or is he too
pompously stupid?) to do more than hire an inept detective to find her. He
remains blindly loyal to his overworked performers, but... could it be an
inside job? The girl might be hidden somewhere on the circus grounds... and
one of the performers might be her abductor!

So you do what anyone would do in these circumstances: set out to rescue the
damsel in distress. The odds aren't in your favor: you - a spectator, a
bystander, an outsider in a defensive close-knit community - trying to find
a girl you've never met, in a place you know nothing about, among bizarre
people who want nothing to do with you. Some would call you brave. Some
would call you foolish.

Every circus has its seedy underside. But few are as dangerous as this.

Difficulty:    ^^^&&

[description]
In Cutthroats, you are a skilled diver living on Hardscrabble Island, a
small seaport past its prime. You will try to salvage a treasure from one of
four shipwrecks; if you are successful, you will be fabulously and
enormously respected among old salts. Some characters in the story will help
you; others will try to stop you any way they can. If you can think
logically and keep your throat intact, the treasure can be yours.

There is more than one shipwreck in Cutthroats, but in each story you will
be trying to recover only one particular treasure. When you restart the

      DEADLINE


1982         Mystery

Difficulty:    ^^^^^

[description]
A wealthy industrialist, Mr. Marshall Robner, locked himself in the upstairs
library of his New England colonial estate one night and committed suicide
by taking a lethal overdose of anti-depressants. Or did he?

You are the Chief of Detectives. You've been asked by Robner's attorney to
make a thorough investigation of the case, simply to "quash the suspicions
which are inevitable" when a moneyed man dies a sudden and unnatural
death. The Medical Examiner found nothing unusual, and interviews with
family members and family associates are consistent with the idea that
Robner committed suicide. Everything fits neatly -- maybe too neatly. You
smell foul play, and you have 12 hours to crack the case. If you arrest
someone, you'd better have the three traditional ingredients to an ironclad
case for the prosecution: the accused must have had a motive, a method, and
ample opportunity to commit the crime. There are many possible endings to
this case, and the one you reach is determined by your actions and by the
deductions you draw from the evidence you gather. But one ending fits the
facts better than any other, and you will know it when you reach it.

     ENCHANTER


1983         Fantasy

Difficulty:    ^^^&&

[description]
An Evil Warlock has subjugated the land to his power. All who have opposed
him have failed. But many years ago, in another age, the great Elders of the
Circle of Enchanters foresaw the possibility of these dreaded occurences.
They realized that no fully accomplished Enchanter could penetrate the
Warlock's defenses unrecognized, and knew that the task of freeing the land
would fall to a journeyman conjurer.

You have been identified as the Apprentice Enchanter who must save the land
from the Warlock.

As a fledgling Enchanter, you have learned your lessons but have not faced
all your tests. You possess great power, but in the ranks of necromancers
you are a lowly and ignorant person indeed. You have been well trained in
the basics of magic, and you will be greatly aided by the spells you know
and the spells you will learn. But you must also rely on your powers of
observation and quick wits.

 HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE
   TO THE GALAXY

1984          Sci-Fi

Difficulty:    ^^^&&

[description]
Don't Panic!

In this story, you will be Arthur Dent, a rather ordinary earth creature who
gets swept up in a whirlwind of interstellar adventures almost beyond
comprehension. As the story begins, bulldozers are waiting to reduce your
house to rubble to make way for a motorway bypass. While you attempt to deal
with this problem, your rather strange friend Ford Prefect drops by to tell
you that the Earth is about to be demolished to make way for an interstellar
bypass! If you survive this double threat, you'll embark on a series of
inter-galactic misadventures even funnier than your worst nightmares! And
because anything is possible in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, you
may soon not even be sure of your own identity!

A special note for people who have read the book The Hitchhiker's Guide to
the Galaxy: although the opening of the game is fairly similar to the book,
the story quickly diverges, with lots of new material and different twists.
Familiarity with the story may make a few of the early puzzles easier, but
if you rely too heavily on this previous knowledge you will certainly
befuddle yourself.

Difficulty:    ^^^&&

[description]
As a child, you spent most of your summers with your Aunt Hildegard and
Uncle Buddy. What memories! Uncle Buddy was a Hollywood big-shot, Aunt
Hildegard his loving (and very rich!) wife. They had no children on their
own, but you and your cousins loved their house, their parties, the
Hollywood memorabilia, and them. Sure, Buddy and Hildy were a bit eccentric
- but that added to their charm.

Aunt Hildegard kept the house when Uncle Buddy passed away. And now that
she's suddenly died, you remember her unusual will. You will inherit the
entire estate - probably worth millions - if you can spend one night in the
house and on the grounds, and find a treasure or two. But if you can't, then
you inherit nothing.

And so Hollywood Hijinx begins with you being dropped off in front of a dark
house, not too far from Hollywood...

You like to think of yourself as a bold and adventurous soldier of fortune,
daring to brave the perils of the Egyptian Desert in search of a great lost

You're all alone. Perhaps the sun has affected your thinking. Do you really
expect to find a lost pyramid in this vast, endless desert, much less
survive?  Even if you do find it, can you get inside? Hardest of all, are
you capable of matching wits with the ancient Egyptians?

Still, you're driven onward against desperate odds. Undreamed-of riches and
treasures beyond imagination await you. And your pride and dignity, your
reputation and self-esteem, are at stake. For you are branded INFIDEL.

turning the region into a Dust Bowl, Alf Landon is running for President,
Victor Hess is receiving the Nobel Prize for Physics for discovering cosmic

embarrassing Adolph Hitler by winning four gold medals at the Olympic Games
in Berlin, Edward the VIII of England is abdicating the throne to marry a
commoner, the Spanish Civil War is beginning to heat up, and the Leather
Goddesses of Phobos are completing plans to invade the Earth and turn it
into their private pleasure world.

Don't let anyone ever tell you that nothing happens in Upper Sandusky, Ohio,
because on this day in 1936, you're snatched out of your favorite bar in
Upper Sandusky - kidnapped by minions of the evil Leather Goddesses. You are
brought back to Phobos as an experimental subject, as preparations continue
to enslave every man and woman on Earth.

If you succeed in escaping the clutches of the Leather Goddesses, you will
begin an odyssey the likes of which you have never even imagined (except,
perhaps, in certain very enjoyable dreams). With your loyal friend and
fellow Earthmate at your side, you will begin a naughty, bawdy, rowdy,
rousing and very, very amusing romp across the solar system. Your mission,
should you be able to catch your breath long enough to think about it, is to
collect the materials you'll need to ultimately defeat the Leather Goddesses
of Phobos and save humanity! Are you "up" for the job?

     PLANETFALL


1983          Sci-Fi

Difficulty:    ^^^&&

[description]
After the fall of the Second Galactic Union in 1716 GY, a ten-thousand-year
dark age settled upon the galaxy. Interstellar travel was non-existent, and
many star systems descended into a near-barbaric state, buring coal and gas
for energy, and growing food directly from exposed topsoil.

In 11,203 GY, a treaty between the Empires of Tremain and Galium formed the
Third Galactic Union. Ships of the Stellar Patrol (a pseudo-military wing of
the Union government on Tremain) began exploring the galaxy, searching for
the human civilizations that are the remnants of the Second Galactic Union.

You are a native of the planet Gallium. Although it is one of the most
politically powerful worlds in the Union, Gallium is no garden spot. In
fact, the Gallium Chamber of Commerce brochure entitled "Ten Great Reasons
to Visit Gallium" ends on page 3. The author ran out of reasons after
listing just two.

For five generations, your family has served in the Stellar Patrol. Your
great-great-grandfather was a High Admiral and one of the founding officers
of the Patrol. It was taken for granted that when you came of age you would
join up.

Now, more than a year after signing up, and two months after being
transferred to the S.P.S. Feinstein, you are still only ranked Ensign
Seventh Class. You superior officer, Ensign First Class Blather, has been
making your life miserable. You're beginning to wonder if you're really cut
out for the Stellar Patrol...

In your late youth you left home to join the Guild of Enchanters. After
years of schooling, you achieved the rank of Apprentice Enchanter. In
fulfillment of an ancient prophecy, you were sent to find Krill, an evil
warlock who had loosed a pestilence upon the land, and who threatened the
very existence of the Circle of Enchanters. Only someone guileless and
inexperienced in the ways of magic could slip into Krill's realm unnoticed.

By defeating Krill, you earned a seat on the Circle of Enchanters, sitting
at the right hand of your mentor, the leader of the Guild, Belboz the
Necromancer. Several years have passed, and you have grown very close to
Belboz as you studied under his tutelage, learning the ways of magic from
one of the world's most learned practitioners.

But lately, Belboz has seemed troubled, preoccupied, withdrawn... small
things only a friend would notice. You have even heard frightening noises
coming from his chamber, and the voices of conversation when Belboz was
supposedly alone. His temper has seemed short the last few days, and the
look in his eyes sends cold shivers down your back. Could some evil spirit
be at work here? You are sleepless from worry - Belboz is possibly the most
powerful Enchanter in the kingdom. If his powers were used by the forces of
darkness instead of the forces of light, who knows what would result?

And now, unbeknownst to you, Belboz has vanished.

1982          Sci-Fi

Difficulty:    ^^^^^

[description]
The year is 2186. Humanity has established colonies on the moon, Mars, and
several of the larger asteroids. Earth's sky is dotted with space habitats,
and the spaceways are always busy. As usual, there is urgent need for energy
to power this advanced civilization; one of the primary sources of that
energy is quantum black holes.

In Starcross you are a miner of black holes, scouring the asteroid belt in
your one-man survey ship. Finding and harnessing a single black hole can
make a person's fortune. It's a lonely business, fraught with the known and
unknown hazards of space. You've equipped your ship, the M.C.S. Starcross
with the best gear you could afford. You've put everything into this
venture, and though you've tried before, you somehow sense that this time
will be different.

The ship's computer handles the functions of navigation and maintenance. You
watch the sophisticated mass detector as it unceasingly scans the vicinity
for unchartered masses. To assuage the tedium of your long trip, you browse
through the compact tape library, a compendium of human knowledge and
culture. But the drone of the ship gradually lulls you into a deep sleep.

As you sleep, you dream of the riches which would be yours if your search
for a quantum black hole is sucessful. Little do you suspect that the alarm
on your mass detector is about to jolt you out of your dream -- but not to
grapple with the long-sought black hole. Your quest hast taken an unexpected
turn, for you are destined to rendezvous with a gargantuan alien space ship
from the outer fringes of the galaxy.

a founding officer of the Stellar Patrol, and for five generations, your
family has served in the Patrol. It was always taken for granted that you
would sign up as soon as you came of age.

Once you joined the Patrol, you discovered that the exciting career promised
in all the Patrol recruitment brochures was nonsense. Your life was drudgery
and demerits. The one time you got to see an exotic planet was right after a
big parade, when they needed a detail to sweep up all the confetti.

Then came your big moment: shipwrecked on a seemingly deserted world, you
met an exuberant robotic companion named Floyd. Together, the two of you
discovered the secret of that mysterious planet, Resida, and saved it from
near destruction.The story of that heroic deed was told in Planetfall.

As a result of your heroics, you were offered, and quickly accepted, a juicy
promotion. Good-bye Ensign Seventh Class -- hello Lieutenant First Class! No
more scrubwork! No more bathroom details! No more cleaning groth cages!
Finally, your life in the Stellar Patrol would be as exciting as those
brochures had promised!

Oh, how naive you'd been. Your daily routine simply replaced tedious
scrubwork with tedious paperwork. Since your planetfall on Resida, five long
years have dragged by, without a single event worthy of note. Why, just look
at today's "thrilling" assignment: scooting over to Space Station Gamma
Delta Gamma 777-G 59/59 Sector Alpha-Mu-79 to pick up a supply of Request
for Stellar Patrol Issue Regulation Black Form Binders Request Form Forms...

year is 1938, and on this stormy February night a wealthy but frightened man
has asked your for protection. In spite of your best efforts, a death will
occur, and you will have twelve hours to solve the mystery and try to arrest
the killer.

If you think you have enough evidence one or more suspects to convince a
jury of their guilt, you can arrest them and conclude the case. Your
ever-helpful assistant, Sergeant Duffy, will assist you in taking the
accused into custody. (He will also offer help before the arrest if you ask
him for it.) You can can except to receive a letter from your superiors
about the outcome of the grand jury investigation - and, if the District
Attorney gets an indictment, of the trial itself. If the jury does not
convict, your higher-ups will probably tell you where you may have erred, so
that you can profit from your mistakes.

Because the state cannot win the case unless it can prove guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt, you are expected to establish the traditional ingredients
of an ironclad case for the prosecution: the accused must have had a motive,
a method, an an ample opportunity to commit the crime. There are many
possible endings to this case, and the one you reach is determined by your
actions and by the deductions you draw from the evidence you gather. But one
ending fits the facts better than any, and you will know it when you reach
it.

 ZORK I: THE GREAT
 UNDERGROUND EMPIRE

1980         Fantasy

Difficulty:    ^^^&&

[description]
Welcome to ZORK! You are about to experience a classic interactive fantasy,
set in a magical universe. The ZORK trilogy takes place in the ruins of an
ancient empire lying far underground. You, a dauntless treasure-hunter, are
venturing into this dangerous land in search of wealth and adventure.
Because each part of the ZORK saga is a completely independent story, you
can explore them in any order. However, since ZORK I is the least difficult,
it is usually the best place to begin.

Many strange tales have been told of the fabulous treasures, exotic
creatures and diabolical puzzles in the Great Underground Empire. As an
aspiring adventurer you will undoubtedly want to locate the treasures and
deposit them in your trophy case. You'd better equip yourself with a source
of light (for the caverns are dark) and weapons (for some of the inhabitants
are unfriendly -- especially the thief, a skilled pickpocket and ruthless
opponent).
